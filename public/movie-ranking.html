<h1>The Best Animes According to Earl</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Animes of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Dragon Ball Franchise</h3>
<p>Now I know this may confuse some but the entire franchise is just that good and it's my favorite. It has produced iconic moments like the first kamehameha and "It's over 9000."</p>
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>I know you're wondering, what the heck is Bleach, it's not for laundry it's anime that has cool words like Bankai and stuff.</p>
<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>This anime has a lot of depth and a little buff guy.</p>
